# Leveraging Machine Learning to Improve Robot Motion Planning in Unknown Environments
Expanding on my ASSIP research in the Computer Systems Lab under Mr. Paul Kosek and Dr. Erion Plaku. This project is titled: Leveraging Machine Learning to Improve Robot Motion Planning in Unknown Environments. This project explores how ML techniques can improve high time-complexity areas when conducting motion planning in unknown environments.

## Abstract
In robot motion planning, the objective is to provide a plan for the robot to get to the desired location while avoiding obstacles. While related work has information about the environment, this framework is able to plan in unknown environments. The robot is equipped with a radial-based sensor that detects obstacles around them as it moves. A map of the environment will be incrementally built and passed on to the planner as information is collected. In certain environments, motion planning runs into complex obstacle arrangements where planning time becomes exponential. This project aims to leverage machine learning to predict plan times. From different areas of the environment, planning times can be predicted, guiding the robot to easier regions of the environment.
