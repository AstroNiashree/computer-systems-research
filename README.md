# Leveraging Machine Learning to Improve Robot Motion Planning in Unknown Environments
Expanding on my ASSIP research in the Computer Systems Lab under Mr. Paul Kosek and Dr. Erion Plaku. This project is titled: Leveraging Machine Learning to Improve Robot Motion Planning in Unknown Environments. This project explores how ML techniques can improve high time-complexity areas when conducting motion planning in unknown environments.
